          I've been reading about some proposals for large, expensive landmark
          artworks in the countryside. I like arty stuff, but I can't help thinking
          that rather than some earnestly meant arty description of what amounts to
          waffle of a thing that's a ditch or a block or a grid or anything you have
          to read about before you understand why it's good.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Instead of that just make something really big - like the Angel of the
          North or the Eiffel Tower or the London Eye. I (and I'm betting a fair few
          others will be with me on this) like big odd things.

          Here's my pitch... ü•Åü•Åü•Å
        </h2>
        
        <ul>
          <li>
            It's a giant fork in a hill.üí•
          </li>
          <li>
            It'd be big. Really big. üí•ü§Øüí•
          </li>
          <li>
            You're going to be able to STAND üëè INBETWEEN üëè THE üëè PRONGS! ‚úãüé§.
          </li>
          <li> It'll include metal from melted down cutlery donated by local people - probably
            those odd forks that you probably accidentally nicked from work. Could
            even be a spoon, who cares. You'll be able to say: "hey y'know what? I put a spoon in the giant fork!" üòÇ. </li>
            <li>I reckon it'd be more fun if local people have tableware in the
          game!ü•Ñüç¥</li>

            <h2>
              Details
            </h2>
        
      <p>
        Also Hill Fork (as it will probably get called) sounds a bit like Hill
        Fort. That's fun too. And of course it'll be in a path... A FORK IN A
        PATH! COME ON! Comedy gold!
      </p>
      <p>
        It can sound rude so it's mildly controversial. I like my controversies
        mild. You know, like talking a selfie, you could say Fork Me, this is big!
        As you gurn from between the prongs. You could stick giant foodstuffs on
        at different times of the year to invent new rituals - the dancing of the
        peas, the loading of the sausage, sweetcorn singalongs.
      </p>
      <p>
        And here's the thing. It doesn't mean anything at all. It doesn't
        represent something. It's just a massive fork stuck in a hill. Because
        that's simply a fun thing to do in my book. It doesn't need a backstory or
        an artist to explore anything - no angst or yearning, no immersion in
        liminal spaces. Bring your own meaning if you like. Or don't. I won't be.
        I find it pure like this. Just a fork in a hill for no reason. Come see
        the fork, it's big mind. Really big.

      <h2>Bring your own meaning</h2>
      <p>
        My feeling is simply that giant versions of everyday things are exciting and fun.  That's where the meaning starts and ends, but feel free to bring your own meaning. For example:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Fork Hill represents mankind's insatiable desire to devour our environment in an orgy of consumerism.</li>
        <li>Using metal reclaimed (or dare I say 'mined') from local cutlery we  return to the earth the very minerals we stole. At the same time branding a reminder of our greed upon our own retina's with a totem of our greed.</li>
        <li>A new icon to worship in a gluttonous age.  Offerings must be made to the fork</li>
        <li>It's a giant FORK YOU! to the elitist art world.</li>
        <li>A reminder in a world of disposable plastic forks that the fork is a mighty and glorious tool to be treated with reverance and awe.</li>
        <li>Something to do with a giant forky Sundial! </li>
      </ul>

      <p>I'll leav it there I'm getting tired! ü•±</p>
      <p>Who's with me?</p>
