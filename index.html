          I've been reading about some proposals for large, expensive landmark
          artworks in the countryside. I like arty stuff, but I can't help thinking
          that rather than some earnestly meant arty description of what amounts to
          waffle of a thing that's a ditch or a block or a grid or anything you have
          to read about before you understand why it's good.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Instead of that just make something really big - like the Angel of the
          North or the Eiffel Tower or the London Eye. I (and I'm betting a fair few
          others will be with me on this) like big odd things.

        <h2>
          So here's my pitch.
        </h2>
        
        <p>
          It's a giant fork in a hill.
        </p>
        <p>
          It'd be big. Really big.
        </p>
        <p>
          You're going to be able to stand in between the prongs to have a nice
          picture taken.
        </p>
        
        <div class="gallery">
          <figure>
            <img src="/img/small/fork-1.png" alt="A giant table fork stuck in a hill">
            <figcaption>Dall.e </figcaption>
          </figure>

          <figure>
            <img src="/img/small/fork-2.png" alt="A giant table fork stuck in a hill">
            <figcaption>Dall.e </figcaption>
          </figure>
          </div>
        
        <p>
          It'd include metal from melted down forks donated by locals - probably
          those odd forks that you probably accidentally nicked from work. Could
          even be a spoon, who cares. You'll be able to say: hey y'know what, I put
        a spoon in the giant hill fork. There will be no deep meaning for adding
        cutlery. I just think it'd be fun for people to have table ware in the
        game.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also Hill Fork (as it will probably get called) sounds a bit like Hill
        Fort. That's fun too. And of course it'll be in a path... A FORK IN A
        PATH! COME ON! Comedy gold!
      </p>
      <p>
        It can sound rude so it's mildly controversial. I like my controversies
        mild. You know, like talking a selfie, you could say Fork Me, this is big!
        As you gurn from between the prongs. You could stick giant foodstuffs on
        at different times of the year to invent new rituals - the dancing of the
        peas, the loading of the sausage, sweetcorn singalongs.
      </p>
      <p>
        And here's the thing. It doesn't mean anything at all. It doesn't
        represent something. It's just a massive fork stuck in a hill. Because
        that's simply a fun thing to do in my book. It doesn't need a backstory or
        an artist to explore anything - no angst or yearning, no immersion in
        liminal spaces. Bring your own meaning if you like. Or don't. I won't be.
        I find it pure like this. Just a fork in a hill for no reason. Come see
        the fork, it's big mind. Really big.
