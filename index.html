    <p class="subheading">An antidote to HIGH CONCEPT / LOW FUN public art proposals? </p>

    <p>
      I've seen a bunch of proposals for large, expensive landmark
      artworks in the countryside. No doubt earnestly meant, but they amount to pages of impenetrable arty nonsense
      painting over a disappointingly mundane 'thing' at the end.
    </p>

    <p>What's wrong with something that's simple to get, easy to like and fun to visit. Think Angel of the North, the
      Eiffel Tower or the London Eye, but without the budget. Closer in spirit and cost to those giant roadside
      attractions in the US. <span class="aside">(E.g. Gnome Chomsky in New York - the world's 2nd or 3rd Largest
        Gnome)</span></p>

    <p>If that last sentence didn't spark a bit a of joy, maybe best not to read on. üòâ</p>


    <h2>
      Here's my pitch... ü•Åü•Åü•Å
    </h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        It's a giant fork in a hill.üí•
      </li>
      <li>
        It'll be big. Really big. üí•ü§Øüí•
      </li>
      <li>
        You're going to be able to STAND üëè BETWEEN üëè THE üëè PRONGS! ‚úãüé§.
      </li>
      <li> It'll include metal from melted down cutlery donated by local people - probably
        those odd forks that you probably accidentally nicked from work. Could
        even be a spoon, who cares. You'll be able to say: "hey y'know what? I put a spoon in the giant fork!" üòÇ. </li>
      <li>I reckon it'd be more fun if local people have tableware in the
        game!ü•Ñüç¥</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="gallery">
      <figure>
        <img width="300" height="300" src="/img/small/fork-1.webp"
          alt="A drawing of a giant table fork stuck in a hill with a path running through the prongs and people looking up from the base of the hill">

      <figure>
        <img width="300" height="300" src="/img/small/fork-2.webp"
          alt="a row of people along the top of a small hill around the prongs of a giant fork which is stuck in the ground.">
        <figcaption>I wasn't keen on the twisted prongs so I politely asked <a
            href="https://labs.openai.com/about">DALL¬∑E</a> for another.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </div>

    <p>
      And here's the thing. It doesn't mean anything at all. It doesn't
      represent something. It's just a massive fork stuck in a hill. Because
      that's simply a fun thing to do in my book. It doesn't need a backstory or
      an artist to explore anything - no angst or yearning, no immersion in
      liminal spaces. Bring your own meaning if you like. Or don't. I won't be.
      I find it pure like this. Just a fork in a hill for no reason. Come see
      the fork, it's big mind. Really big.
    </p>

    <h2>
      Pun opportunities
    </h2>
    <p>When all is said and done, we are simple folk. I reckon more of us enjoy shouting "FORK ME!" while taking a
      selfie next to a giant fork, than studiously reading a pdf about why the pile of rubble in front of them is worthy
      of attention.</p>
    <p>Too few artists consider the punning opportunities when creating their masterpieces and that is a crying shame..
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Hill Fork is a bit like Hill Fort - weak, but it's a start</li>
      <li>The Fork can straddle a path... It'll be A FORK IN THE PATH... COME ON! Comedy gold!</li>
      <li>When you arrive you shall declare "Fork Me that's big!". "Fork you?" will be your companion's response
        enquiring about a photo opportunity. After gurning and picnicking beneath the prongs you'll suggest "Fork off?"
        and leave knowing you have justly punned.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>
      Rituals
    </h2>
    <p>
      Giant foodstuffs could be place upon the prongs at different times of the year to invent new rituals - the dancing
      of the peas, the loading of the sausage, sweetcorn sonnets.
    </p>

    <h2>Bring your own meaning</h2>
    <p>
      My feeling is simply that giant versions of everyday things are exciting and fun. That's where the meaning starts
      and ends, but feel free to bring your own meaning. For example:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Fork Hill represents mankind's insatiable desire to devour our environment in an orgy of consumerism.</li>
      <li>Using metal reclaimed (or dare I say 'mined') from local cutlery we return to the earth the very minerals we
        stole. At the same time branding a reminder of our greed upon our own retina's with a totem of our greed.</li>
      <li>A call to arms for all of us to embrace our childhood selves and to ask why, why, why more often?</li>
      <li>A new icon to worship in a gluttonous age. Offerings must be made to the fork, or your fast food emporiums
        will run dry of grease and stodge </li>
      <li>It's a giant FORK YOU! to the elitist art world.</li>
      <li>A reminder in a world of disposable plastic forks that the fork is a mighty and glorious tool to be treated
        with reverence and awe.</li>
      <li>Something to do with a giant forky Sundial! </li>
    </ul>
    <p>I'll leave it there I'm getting tired! ü•±</p>

    <p>Who's with me?</p>
